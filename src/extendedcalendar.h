  @section introduction Introduction

  mKCal library extends KCalendarCore library to add a persistant storage
  in a sqlite database.

  This two libraries come from the original KCal from KDE. They have been
  split refactored, and some functionality has been added.

  @section architecture Architecture

  There are two important base classes.
  <ul>
  <li>Abstract class <b>Calendar</b> from KCalendarCore contain incidences
  (events, todos, journals) and methods for adding/deleting/querying them.
  It is implemented by <b>ExtendedCalendar</b> in mKCal.

  <li>Abstract class <b>ExtendedStorage</b> defines the interface to load
  and save calendar incidences into permanent storage. It is implemented
  by a few diffent storages, like <b>SqliteStorage</b> which is the default
  MeeGo storage. But more can be added implementing this interface.
  </ul>

  Calendars can exist without storages but storages must always be linked
  to a calendar. The normal way to create calendar and default storage is:
  @code
  ExtendedCalendar::Ptr cal =
    ExtendedCalendar::Ptr ( new ExtendedCalendar( QLatin1String( "UTC" ) ) );
  ExtendedStorage::Ptr storage = calendar.defaultStorage( cal );
  storage->open();
  @endcode

  Initially calendar is empty unless you create new incidences into it,
  or use the storage to load incidences into the calendar.
  Original KCal provided only means for loading all incidences at once,
  but that may be too costly for an embedded device (loading could take
  tens of seconds for very large calendars). ExtendedStorage added
  methods for smart loading only those incidences that must be shown
  to the user at that time.

  When you add incidences to the calendar, or modify/delete existing
  ones, you must call storage->save() to write incidences into persistent
  storage. Calendar methods always operate in memory only, you can make
  a series of changes in a calendar and then 'commit' them all at once
  by calling storage->save().

  Another extension to original KCal are multiple notebooks (calendars
  for the user). Every incidence is assigned to a notebook.
  The correct way to create an incidence (simple todo in this case) is this:
  @code
  QDateTime now = QDateTime::currentDateTime();
  Notebook::Ptr personal( "Personal" );

  Todo::Ptr todo = Todo::Ptr( new Todo() );
  todo->setSummary( "A todo for testing" );
  todo->setDtDue( now.addDays(1), true );
  todo->setHasDueDate( true );
  calendar.addTodo( todo, personal );
  storage.save();
  @endcode

  Notice that we first create the incidence, then add it to the calendar
  and then tell calendar which notebook the incidence belongs to. Finally
  the note is saved to the storage.

  Notebooks are created/modified/deleted through storages.
  Notebooks are referred by their name only in the calendar.
  To create it, see this example:
  @code
  storage.addNotebook( notebook );
  @endcode

  @section environment Environment

  Here is an ascii art diagram of the typical organiser environment.

  There are usually two processes using libmkcal, one is the calendar
  application visible to the user, and the other is synchronization daemon
  that updates calendar data periodically on the background.

  Change notifications (through the observer classes) are sent when incidences
  are saved in either process.
  Also during save storage sets possible alarms to alarm daemon (if compiled
  with TIMED_SUPPORT) which sets an alarm to be shown by other reminder service.
  Based on user action the alarm may be canceled, snoozed, or opened to the user
  in calendar application.

  @endcode

  @section Correct usage
  When one incidence is added into a calendar, every time one property is modified
  all the observers are notfied of the change. So in case lots of modifications are
  being done it can be a very expensive operation.
  The correct way to avoid is
  @code
  incidence->startUpdates();
  //do modifications here
  incidence->endUpdates();
  @code
  Also the call calendar->load() is a very expensive operation. Use it with care and only
  load a notebook, a date range, etc.

  Calling the storage->save() is also an expensive operation. So if adding lots of incidences
  do not call save every time.
